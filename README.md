# Retrieval of Ocean Wave Characteristics via Time-Differenced Carrier Phases from Single Frequency GNSS Buoys

This repository contains the programming code related to the paper titled "Retrieval of Ocean Wave Characteristics via Time-Differenced Carrier Phases from Single Frequency GNSS Buoys." The paper's main focus is the use of the TDCP method to measure buoy velocities and further calculate SWH and periodic information. The code has been primarily written in Python, and the TDCP method has taken inspiration from the RTKLib open-source program.
